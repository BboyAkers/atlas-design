Welcome to Atomics âš›! These are small, single purpose, css classes that can be used to compose great things. Visit this article for a [longer definition of Atomics CSS here](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/#:~:text=Atomic%20CSS%20is%20the%20approach,names%20based%20on%20visual%20function).

## Categories of classes

Most of our classes fall into one of several categories. Those that affect ...

- display
- spacing

## Naming patterns

All of our atomic classes try to follow the same pattern.

```txt
.<css-property-name>-<value>
// or
.<css-property-name>-<value>-<screensize>
```
