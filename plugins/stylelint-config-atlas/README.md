# stylelint-config-atlas

This stylelint configuration will provide the inherited lint rules for the Atlas CSS project. This has been factored into a separate package to allow us to inherit our rules while still keeping up with the `stylelint-config-prettier` package, which disables rules that conflict with Prettier.
